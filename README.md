# CSCI-N311: Advanced Database Programming, Oracle
:card_index_dividers: Course Projects for Advanced Database Programming in Oracle

### Description
This is a group of all the major projects done for _CSCI-N311_. Note that the purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my growth in style and understanding of SQL/PL and Oracle. You will see my coding style change as the semester progressed from the Midterm Project to the Final Project. 

The course contained multiple miniature projects called "labs," and an overarching project. The miniature labs are not included in this repository for possible academic cheating purposes. The Midterm and Final Projects build off of one another. Students are asked to design a database for a purpose of their choosing. The database initially meets N3 requirements, and ends the semester at N4. 

The Honors Project is an extension of the class. I chose to take on this project out of a desire to more deeply apply the learned skills in this class. 

### Demonstrated Skills 
<h4>✔️ Oracle SQL 
<h4>✔️ Oracle PL/SQL
<h4>✔️ Database Design 
<h4>✔️ Fast & Safe Operations
