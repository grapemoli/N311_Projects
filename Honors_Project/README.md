# Description (copied from the Professor's Description)
Two companies are merged, thus data from two separate databases need to be merged into one database. Both databases have a table that stores basic customer information, but with different fields and settings. You are going to write a piece of program to take data from the source table, process data where necessary to meet the requirements of the destination table, and insert data into the destination table.
